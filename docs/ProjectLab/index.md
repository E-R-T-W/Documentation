The Project Lab enables you to prototype and build IoT without having to do any breadboarding or soldering. Just use the built in peripherals and/or plug in any of the thousands of peripherals in the Grove/Stemma/Qwiic/mikroBUS ecosystem and build today. 

If you'd like to purchase one, check out the [Wilderness Labs Store](https://store.wildernesslabs.co/).
